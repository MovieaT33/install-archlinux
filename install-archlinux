# Pre-installation

## Set the console keyboard layout and font

### The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:
# localectl list-keymaps

### To set the keyboard layout, pass its name to loadkeys(1). For example, to set a United States keyboard layout:
loadkeys us

### Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ and can likewise be set with setfont(8) omitting the path and file extension. For example, to use one of the largest fonts suitable for HiDPI screens, run:

read -p "Want a larger font? [Y/n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	setfont ter-132b
else
	setfont
fi

## Verify the boot mode

### To verify the boot mode, check the UEFI bitness:
# cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size

EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE=64
fw_platform_size=$(cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size)

echo "Verifying the boot mode..."

if [[ $fw_platform_size -ne $EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE ]]; then
  echo "Error: Verifying the boot mode failed. The system must be UEFI $EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE-bit, not $fw_platform_size-bit."
  exit 1
fi

## Connect to the internet

### Ensure your network interface is listed and enabled, for example with ip-link(8):
# ip link

### The connection may be verified with ping:
# ping archlinux.org

HOST=archlinux.org
PING_COUNT=4

echo "Verifying the connection to the internet..."

if ! ping -c $PING_COUNT $HOST > /dev/null; then
  echo "Error: Verifying the connection to the internet failed. Unable to reach $HOST."
  exit 1
fi

## Update the system clock

### Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is synchronized
# timedatectl

## Partition the disks

read -p "Want to format your device? [Y/n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	cfdisk /dev/vda  # TODO: auto formatting device
fi

## Encrypt device

DEVICE=/dev/vda
ENCRYPT_DEVICE="$DEVICE2"
ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME=crypt
VOLUME_GROUP_NAME=vg0

echo "Encrypting $ENCRYPT_DEVICE device..."

### Create luks partition

echo "Creating luks partition..."
read -p "Want to encrypt $ENCRYPT_DEVICE device? [Y/n]" answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	cryptsetup luksFormat $DEVICE

### Open the encrypted device

	echo "Opening the $ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME device..."
	cryptsetup luksOpen $DEVICE $ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME

### Use the device as phisical volume

	echo "Using the device as phisical volume..."
	pvcreate /dev/mapper/$ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME

### Create a volume group

	echo "Creating a $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME volume group..."
	vgcreate $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME /dev/mapper/$ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME

## Create the logical volumes

	SWAP_SIZE="4G"

	echo "Creating the logical volumes..."
	echo "Creating the swap logical volume with $SWAP_SIZE size..."
	lvcreate -n swap -L $SWAP_SIZE $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME
	echo "Creating the root logical volume..."
	lvcreate -n root -l 100%FREE $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME
fi

echo "The installation was successful!"
echo "You can uninstall script by `make uninstall` command."
