# Pre-installation

## Set the console keyboard layout and font

### The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:
# localectl list-keymaps

### To set the keyboard layout, pass its name to loadkeys(1). For example, to set a United States keyboard layout:

KEYBOARD_LAYOUT="us"
loadkeys $KEYBOARD_LAYOUT
echo -e "Setted the ${BLUE}keyboard layout${RESET} -> $KEYBOARD_LAYOUT"

### Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ and can likewise be set with setfont(8) omitting the path and file extension. For example, to use one of the largest fonts suitable for HiDPI screens, run:

LARGE_FONT="ter-132b"
DEFAULT_FONT=""

read -p "Want a ${BLUE}larger font${RESET}? [$Y_or_n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	FONT=$LARGE_FONT
else
	FONT=$DEFAULT_FONT
fi

setfont $FONT

## Verify the boot mode

### To verify the boot mode, check the UEFI bitness:
# cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size

EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE=64
fw_platform_size=$(cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size)

printf "Verifying the boot mode..."

if [[ $fw_platform_size -ne $EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE ]]; then
	echo -e " ${ERROR}: The system must be UEFI $EXPECTED_FW_PLATFORM_SIZE-bit, not $fw_platform_size-bit"
	exit 1
else
	echo -e " ${OK}"
fi

## Connect to the internet

### Ensure your network interface is listed and enabled, for example with ip-link(8):
# ip link

### The connection may be verified with ping:
# ping archlinux.org

HOST="archlinux.org"
PING_COUNT=4

printf "Verifying the connection to the internet..."

if ! ping -c $PING_COUNT $HOST > /dev/null; then
	echo -e " ${ERROR}: Unable to reach $HOST."
	exit 1
else:
	echo -e " ${OK}"
fi

## Update the system clock

### Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is synchronized
# timedatectl

## Partition the disks

DEVICE="/dev/vda"
ENCRYPT_DEVICE="${DEVICE}2"
ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME="crypt"
VOLUME_GROUP_NAME="vg0"

read -p "Want to ${BLUE}format${RESET} your device? [Y/n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	cfdisk $DEVICE  # TODO: auto formatting device
fi

## Encrypt device

echo "Encrypting ${BLUE}${ENCRYPT_DEVICE}${RESET} device..."

### Create luks partition

echo "Creating luks partition..."
sleep 5
read -p "Want to encrypt device? [Y/n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	cryptsetup luksFormat $DEVICE

### Open the encrypted device

	echo "Opening the $ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME device..."
	cryptsetup luksOpen $ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME $ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME
fi

### Use the device as phisical volume

read -p "Want to create volumes? [Y/n] " answer
answer=$(echo "$answer" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

if [[ "$answer" == "" || "$answer" == "y" ]]; then
	echo "Using the device as phisical volume..."
	pvcreate /dev/mapper/$ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME

### Create a volume group

	echo "Creating a $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME volume group..."
	vgcreate $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME /dev/mapper/$ENCRYPTED_DEVICE_NAME

## Create the logical volumes

	SWAP_SIZE="4G"

	echo "Creating the logical volumes..."
	echo "Creating the swap logical volume with $SWAP_SIZE size..."
	lvcreate -n swap -L $SWAP_SIZE $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME
	echo "Creating the root logical volume..."
	lvcreate -n root -l 100%FREE $VOLUME_GROUP_NAME
fi

echo "The installation was ${GREEN}successful${RESET}!"
echo "You can ${RED}uninstall${RED} installation script by \`make uninstall\` command."
